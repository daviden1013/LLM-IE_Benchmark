# Task description
This is a named entity recognition task. Given a medical note, annotate the events (EVENT) and time expressions (TIMEX3):

# Schema definition
Your output should contain: 
    "entity_text": the exact wording as mentioned in the note.
    "entity_type": type of the entity. It should be one of the "EVENT" or "TIMEX3".
    if entity_type is "EVENT",
        "type": the event type as one of the "TEST", "PROBLEM", "TREATMENT", "CLINICAL_DEPT", "EVIDENTIAL", or "OCCURRENCE".
        "polarity": whether an EVENT is positive ("POS") or negative ("NAG"). For example, in “the patient reports headache, and denies chills”, the EVENT [headache] is positive in its polarity, and the EVENT [chills] is negative in its polarity.
        "modality": whether an EVENT actually occurred or not. Must be one of the "FACTUAL", "CONDITIONAL", "POSSIBLE", or "PROPOSED".

    if entity_type is "TIMEX3",
        "type": the type as one of the "DATE", "TIME", "DURATION", or "FREQUENCY".
        "val": the numeric value 1) DATE: [YYYY]-[MM]-[DD], 2) TIME: [hh]:[mm]:[ss], 3) DURATION: P[n][Y/M/W/D]. So, “for eleven days” will be 
represented as “P11D”, meaning a period of 11 days. 4)  R[n][duration], where n denotes the number of repeats. When the n is omitted, the expression denotes an unspecified amount of repeats. For example, “once a day for 3 days” is “R3P1D” (repeat the time interval of 1 day (P1D) for 3 times (R3)), twice every day is “RP12H” (repeat every 12 hours)
        "mod": additional information regarding the temporal value of a time expression. Must be one of the:
            “NA”: the default value, no relevant modifier is present;  
            “MORE”, means “more than”, e.g. over 2 days (val = P2D, mod = MORE);  
            “LESS”, means “less than”, e.g. almost 2 months (val = P2M, mod=LESS); 
            “APPROX”, means “approximate”, e.g. nearly a week (val = P1W, mod=APPROX);  
            “START”, describes the beginning of a period of time, e.g.  Christmas morning, 2005 (val= 2005-12-25, mod= START).  
            “END”, describes the end of a period of time, e.g. late last year, (val = 2010, mod = END)
            “MIDDLE”, describes the middle of a period of time, e.g. mid-September 2001 (val = 2001-09, mod = MIDDLE) 

# Output format definition
Your output should follow JSON format, 
if there are one of the EVENT or TIMEX3 entity mentions:
    [
        {"entity_text": "<Exact entity mentions as in the note>", "entity_type": "EVENT", "type": "<event type>", "polarity": "<event polarity>", "modality": "<event modality>"},
        {"entity_text": "<Exact entity mentions as in the note>", "entity_type": "TIMEX3", "type": "<TIMEX3 type>", "val": "<time value>", "mod": "<additional information>"}
        ...
     ]
if there is no entity mentioned in the given note, just output an empty list:
    []

I am only interested in the extracted contents in []. Do NOT explain your answer.
