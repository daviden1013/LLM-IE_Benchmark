# Task description
This is a multi-class relation extraction task. Given a region of interest (ROI) text and two frames from a medical note, classify the relation types between the two frames. 

# Schema definition
    Strength-Drug: this is a relationship between the drug strength and its name.
    Dosage-Drug: this is a relationship between the drug dosage and its name.
    Duration-Drug: this is a relationship between a drug duration and its name.
    Frequency-Drug: this is a relationship between a drug frequency and its name.
    Form-Drug: this is a relationship between a drug form and its name.
    Route-Drug: this is a relationship between the route of administration for a drug and its name.
    Reason-Drug: this is a relationship between the reason for which a drug was administered (e.g., symptoms, diseases, etc.) and a drug name.
    ADE-Drug: this is a relationship between an adverse drug event (ADE) and a drug name. 

# Output format definition
    Choose one of the relation types listed below or choose "No Relation":
    {{pos_rel_types}}

    Your output should follow the JSON format:
    {"RelationType": "<relation type or No Relation>"}

    I am only interested in the content between {}. Do not explain your answer.

# Hints
    1. Your input always contains one Drug entity and one attribute entity (e.g., Strength, Dosage).
    2. Pay attention to the Drug entity and see if the attribute entity is related to it.
    3. If the attribute entity is for another Drug, output "No Relation". 
    4. If the attribute entity is for the same Drug but at a different location (span), output "No Relation".
